TOOL-STUDY-0 owner status:

- `TRACK_B_MEDIA_PROCESSING`: complete in `codex/rp-tool-study-0-track-b-media-processing` as docs/diagnostics only.
- `SOUND_MUSIC_AUDIO`: complete in `codex/rp-tool-study-0-sound-music-audio-clean` as docs/diagnostics only.

The Track B study covers OpenCV, PyAV, PySceneDetect, Sharp/libvips, DuckDB, Polars, PaddleOCR, PaddlePaddle, Track B route/capability manifest metadata, Track B cost/capacity metadata, and Track B benchmark/sidecar metadata. It explicitly hands off DeepFilterNet, Signalsmith Stretch, and Demucs to `SOUND_MUSIC_AUDIO`; creative/image-generation tools to `AI_TOOLS_CREATIVE_GRAPHICS`; and final render/export to `TRACK_A_RENDER_EXPORT`.

The Sound/Music/Audio study covers DeepFilterNet, FFmpeg/FFprobe loudness and normalization planning, AudioFlux candidate metadata, Signalsmith Stretch, SoundSync cue planning, music ducking/mix/QA metadata, Lyria planning, Mirelo SFX V1.5, MMAudio V2, internal SFX library planning, Demucs blocked review, and audio cost/capacity metadata. It keeps Demucs blocked pending provenance/legal/human approval and keeps all audio/runtime/provider/tool/worker/route execution blocked.

The AI Tools Creative Graphics study covers AI image generation planning, AI image editing planning, style transfer planning, thumbnails/covers/posters, title cards, lower thirds, overlays, typography/layout/composition metadata, brand/visual style metadata, graphic asset QA metadata, design prompt-to-intent routing, creative graphics route/capability metadata, and creative graphics cost/capacity metadata. It keeps provider/model calls, image generation, image editing, tool/worker/route execution, public artifacts, signed URLs, Supabase writes, beta, and production blocked.

The Track A Render/Export study covers final timeline assembly planning, render/export planning, mux/transcode/container planning, codec quality profile planning, caption/subtitle/burn-in planning, overlay/title/lower-third placement handoff, audio/video sync handoff, preview/proxy/export QA metadata, artifact manifest/checksum/private GCS path planning, retention/delete/rollback planning, export cost/capacity metadata, and final export route/capability metadata. It keeps render/export runtime, workers, tools, routes, providers, media processing, GCS uploads, manifest writes, public artifacts, signed URLs, Supabase writes, beta, and production blocked.

- Batch 1 is centrally rolled up; FFmpeg/FFprobe are version-proven only for the Track A container path at `5.1.9-0+deb12u1`.
- Next primary prompt: `OPEN_SOURCE_TOOL_STACK_OWNER_LANE_RECONCILIATION_AFTER_BATCH_1_ROLLUP`.
- Secondary prompts: `OPEN_SOURCE_TOOL_STACK_BATCH_2_INSTALL_PROOF_APPROVAL`, `PRODUCT_INTERNAL_BETA_READINESS_AGGREGATION_AFTER_OPEN_SOURCE_BATCH_1`, `E2E_VALIDATION_QUEUE_BLOCKER_RESOLUTION_AFTER_OPEN_SOURCE_BATCH_1`.
- Media processing, render/export, worker/route/provider execution, Supabase/GCS/public artifact/signed URL delivery, beta, and production remain blocked.
- Supabase classification: no write / environment none / SQL none / migration no.

## Owner-Lane Reconciliation After Batch 1 Rollup

- Decision: `owner_lane_reconciliation_passed_ready_for_staged_owner_merge_plan`.
- Central Batch 1 bounded proof remains accepted; owner-lane evidence is reconciled as metadata/dry-run/accepted-with-warnings only.
- 71 candidates remain inventoried; 13 AI graphics tools are accepted-with-warnings in the worker metadata lane.
- End-to-end product-ready tools remain `0`; do not claim 40+ tools are installed/proven end-to-end.
- Next prompt: `OPEN_SOURCE_TOOL_STACK_STAGED_OWNER_MERGE_PLAN_AFTER_BATCH_1_ROLLUP`.
- Supabase classification: no write / environment none / SQL none / migration no.

## Staged Owner Merge Plan After Batch 1 Rollup

Decision: `staged_owner_merge_plan_passed_ready_for_e2e_validation_pr305_hydration_blocker_resolution`.

Primary next prompt: `E2E_VALIDATION_PR_305_HYDRATION_BLOCKER_RESOLUTION`.

PR #523 is merged and now serves as source evidence for the unresolved PR #305 hydration blocker. PR #523 merged at 2026-06-19T02:04:29Z with merge commit f258967676c4877d3e1627b5710b789cff04b451. PR #305 remains blocked by pr_305_validation_blocked_npm_ci_failed. Merge-ready validations remain 0.

The staged plan keeps 71 candidates inventoried, Batch 1 bounded proof only, 13 AI graphics tools accepted-with-warnings in worker metadata dry-run scope only, and 0 end-to-end product-ready tools.

Do not claim 40+ tools are installed/proven end-to-end. Worker runtime, media processing, render/export, Supabase/GCS/public delivery, beta, and production remain blocked.
