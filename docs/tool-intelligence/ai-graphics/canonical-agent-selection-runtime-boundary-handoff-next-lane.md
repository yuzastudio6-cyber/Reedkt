# AI Graphics Runtime Boundary Handoff Next Lane

Decision: `ai_graphics_canonical_agent_selection_runtime_boundary_handoff_review_passed_with_warnings`

Next prompt recommendation: `AI_GRAPHICS_CANONICAL_AGENT_SELECTION_RUNTIME_BOUNDARY_HANDOFF_QA_REVIEW`.

## Safety Boundary

- Agent selection may consume runtime-boundary metadata only for planning/study metadata.
- CPU/static validated tools remain not agent-executable.
- Browser chart runtime remains future-only.
- Animation runtime remains future-only.
- Browser/canvas/WebGL runtime remains future-only.
- Model CPU/GPU runtime remains future-only.
- Tool Route handoff remains future-only.
- Worker handoff remains future-only.
- Public artifacts and signed URLs remain future-only.
- Track B remains under TRACK_B_MEDIA_OSS_STEWARD as evidence-only exclusion context.
- Track A render/export exclusion via PR #544 remains evidence-only context.
- Internal owner labels are not product-facing capability names.
- No E2E proof, runtime readiness, internal beta, external beta, or production readiness is approved.
