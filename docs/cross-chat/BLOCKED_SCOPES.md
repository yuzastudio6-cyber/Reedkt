# Blocked Scopes

The post-merge source-of-truth verification keeps these scopes blocked:

- production release
- external beta
- paid production
- general worker execution
- tool execution
- route execution
- provider calls
- media processing and broad media runtime
- Track B media tool runtime, including OpenCV, PyAV, PySceneDetect, Sharp/libvips, PaddleOCR, PaddlePaddle, DuckDB, and Polars
- Sound/Music/Audio runtimes, including DeepFilterNet, FFmpeg/FFprobe audio execution, AudioFlux, Signalsmith Stretch, Lyria, Mirelo, MMAudio, internal SFX library execution, and Demucs
- AI Tools creative graphics execution
- AI image generation and AI image editing runtimes
- creative graphics provider/model calls
- Track A runtime execution
- Track A render/export runtime, Remotion rendering, mux/transcode execution, caption burn-in output, manifest writes, private GCS uploads, public delivery, and export worker execution
- Docker, Cloud Run, or Cloud Build mutation
- Supabase writes, SQL, migrations, reset, repair, or production promotion
- public artifacts
- signed URLs as source-of-truth
- raw prompt execution
- beta or production unlocks

Blocked means no owner should treat the frozen-batch merge or this verification as runtime/product execution approval.

The `SOUND_MUSIC_AUDIO` TOOL-STUDY-0 completion is docs/diagnostics only. Demucs remains blocked pending provenance/legal/human approval, RNNoise is not active, and tool-route execution remains blocked until remaining owner studies and separate route execution gates pass.

The `AI_TOOLS_CREATIVE_GRAPHICS` TOOL-STUDY-0 completion is docs/diagnostics only. AI image generation planning, AI image editing planning, style transfer planning, thumbnails/covers/posters, title cards, lower thirds, overlays, typography/layout/composition metadata, brand/visual style metadata, graphic asset QA metadata, design prompt-to-intent routing, and creative graphics route/cost metadata do not unlock provider/model calls, image generation, image editing, workers, tools, routes, public artifacts, signed URLs, Supabase writes, beta, or production.

The `TRACK_A_RENDER_EXPORT` TOOL-STUDY-0 completion is docs/diagnostics only. Final timeline assembly planning, render/export planning, mux/transcode/container planning, codec quality profile planning, caption/subtitle/burn-in planning, overlay/title/lower-third placement handoff, audio/video sync handoff, preview/proxy/export QA metadata, artifact manifest/checksum/private GCS path planning, retention/delete/rollback planning, export cost/capacity metadata, and final export route/capability metadata do not unlock render/export runtime, workers, tools, routes, providers, media processing, GCS uploads, public artifacts, signed URLs, Supabase writes, beta, or production.

The `TOOL_STUDY_0_ROLLUP` completion is also docs/diagnostics only. It records `docs_diagnostics_complete:true` and decision `blocked_pending_owner_study_merge`; it does not unlock route execution, tool execution, worker execution, provider calls, media/audio/render/export execution, browser capture, map rendering, Supabase writes, GCS uploads, public artifacts, signed URLs, raw prompt execution, beta, production, dependency mutation, or PR merges.

<!-- TOOL_ROUTE_DRY_RUN_APPROVAL_STATUS -->

The tool-route dry-run approval packet does not unblock real execution. Tool execution, route execution, worker execution, provider calls, media/audio/render/image processing, browser capture, map rendering, Supabase writes, public artifacts, signed URLs, raw prompts, beta, paid production, and production remain blocked.

OPEN_SOURCE_TOOL_STACK_INSTALL_PROOF_APPROVAL_BATCH_1_RERUN:

- Decision: `approved_for_future_open_source_tool_stack_batch_1_install_proof_execution`.
- The Batch 1 rerun approval authorizes only a future no-install, no-lock-mutation proof execution packet.
- DuckDB, Polars, Sharp/libvips, FFmpeg, FFprobe, route/capability manifest validation, fixture/report validation, and inventory/proof matrix validation remain unrun by this packet.

<!-- OPEN_SOURCE_BATCH_1_APPROVAL_STATUS:end -->

<!-- OPEN_SOURCE_BATCH_1_EXECUTION_STATUS:start -->
The Batch 1 proof execution does not unblock missing optional tools or broad runtime. DuckDB, Polars, FFmpeg, and FFprobe remain unavailable in this environment until a separate install/proof review approves and lands them. Broad tool execution, route execution, worker execution, provider/model calls, real media/audio/render/image/browser/map work, Supabase/GCS writes, public artifacts, signed URLs, raw prompts, dependency mutation, external beta, paid production, and production remain blocked.

<!-- OPEN_SOURCE_MISSING_OPTIONAL_PACKAGE_BINARY_APPROVAL_STATUS:end -->

<!-- OPEN_SOURCE_MISSING_OPTIONAL_PACKAGE_BINARY_EXECUTION_STATUS:start -->
The missing optional package/binary execution does not unblock broad runtime. DuckDB remains unproven until a separate package-install-script/native-binding review passes.
